# luajit.io

## Introduction

**Pure lua io framework, which re-implements the functionalities and performance of nginx and ngx_lua.**

Why reinvent the wheel? Well, the nginx and ngx_lua is renowned at effciency and extensible, but they are written in C language, so you need to be as smart as the authors to contribute codes. What if the core is written in pure lua language, but without any effciency tradeoff? Then not only the web apps are extensible, but also the server core is extensible at ease by any levels of developers!

The Luajit is a perfect JIT engine to improve lua performance, so with dedicated and luajit-oriented design, the luajit.io would reassemble the advantages of nginx and ngx_lua, but provides extra benefit: simple and extensible at the core.
